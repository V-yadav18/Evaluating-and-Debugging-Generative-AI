# Evaluating and Debugging Generative AI - Learning Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Evaluating and Debugging Generative AI" short course by Deeplearning.AI, where Carey Phelps, founding product manager at Weights and Biases, and instructor for this course, joins Andrew to explore essential tools and best practices for systematically tracking and debugging generative AI models during the development process.

## Course Overview

The course is designed to address the challenges of managing and tracking machine learning model training and evaluation, especially for generative AI models. Generative AI models, including large language models for text generation and diffusion models for image generation, add an additional layer of complexity compared to supervised learning. The course aims to provide learners with the skills and tools necessary to efficiently drive improvements in their generative AI projects.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Experiment Tracking and Visualization

Learn how to systematically keep track of data, model, and hyperparameter options. Understand the importance of tracking experiments and visualizing results for efficient development.

### 2. Monitoring Diffusion Models

Explore techniques for monitoring diffusion models, with a focus on understanding the complexities involved in generating images.

### 3. Evaluating and Fine-tuning LLMs (Large Language Models)

Delve into the evaluation and fine-tuning of large language models, recognizing the challenges posed by the complexity of their output.

### 4. Debugging and Evaluation Tools

Discover a range of debugging and evaluation tools provided by Weights and Biases, including:
- Experiments for tracking machine learning experiments.
- Artifacts for versioning and storing datasets and models.
- Tables for visualizing and examining model predictions.
- Reports for collaborating and sharing experimental results.
- Model Registry for managing the lifecycle of models.
- Prompts for evaluating large-language model generation.

### 5. Compatibility with Frameworks and Platforms

Understand how these tools can seamlessly integrate with various frameworks and computing platforms, such as Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
